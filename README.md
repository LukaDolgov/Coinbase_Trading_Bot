# Cointbase_Trading_Bot
This is my first attempt at a trading bot using machine learning

I am using an LSTM model to track stock price and my bot will make a decision based off long-trades only.

I have replicated coinbase order books with their API because due to my father's work I am unable to trade on a real account and therefore made my own fake brokerage through coinbase which replicates transactions and crypto orderbooks.
